## Overview
In autoPET IV challenge (Task I), we primarily investigated the incorporation of human guidance for lesion segmentation in PET/CT. Inspired by top-performing teams in preceding challenges, our method adopts an integrated pipeline, including Tracer Classification, Lesion Segmentation, Organ Supervision and Post-processing. To efficiently leverage iterative interactions and progressively enhance segmentation accuracy, we explored stochastic click sampling strategies during training.

### Classifier:
- **Tracer Classifier**: Weights for tracer classification on the autoPET dataset was made publicly available by H. Kalisch et al. at https://github.com/hakal104/autoPETIII/ .

### Segmentation Models:
- **FDG Models**: 
For FDG lesion segmentation, we trained two nnU-Net models with identical architecture and methods but different training strategies:
  1. Full Guided model: All 10 FG/BG clicks were concatenated as input channels to enhance the model's performance with maximal human guidance.
  2. Stochastic Click Sampling: A random number of clicks (between 0 and 10) were sampled to simulate varying levels of user interaction in training data, so as to create a more balanced model optimized for progressive human interaction.

    In final submission, we chose different models based on the number of clicks provided in the test phase. For cases with limited user guidance (0-5 clicks), the Stochastic Click Sampling model is employed for prediction; for cases with dense human guidance (6-10 clicks), the Full Guided model would be selected.

- **PSMA Model**: 
The PSMA model was trained specifically on the PSMA dataset with the stochastic click sampling approach. A pre-trained weights by M. Rokuss et al. (https://zenodo.org/records/13753413) was used for initialization.
